          <h3 class="brand-color">APPLICATION</h3>
          <p class="justify-text">All CO2 lasers are capable of engraving and cutting the same types of materials. What you can or cannot laser is determined largely by how well that material absorbs the wavelength of the CO2 laser beam. Identify everything from the different items and material types you wish to process, to the relative proportions you might encounter.</p>

          <h3 class="brand-color">DIMENSIONS</h3>
          <p class="justify-text">Make a list of the min and max dimensions you will need to accommodate. Are all the items flat or are some curved or even cylindrical? If you are planning to laser cut completely through the material, then how thick is it? This will be key in selecting a table size while making sure your laser engraver has enough height clearance for bulkier items.</p>

          <p class="justify-text">Make sure your CO2 laser engraver is well equiped to keep up with your demand. Knowing your projected quantities will help determine the appropriate wattage and beam delivery method to meet your desired cycle times. Did you know you can even have more than one laser head per machine?</p>

          <h3 class="brand-color">FINISH</h3>
          <p class="justify-text">It's important to realize that for the most, the material and how well it reacts to the CO2 laser's wavelength, determines the final look and feel of the mark being made. While you can certainly fine tune your settings to reach a desired depth or texture, the rest has already been predetermined. Research to learn if the type of mark you anticipate can be produced by a CO2 laser engraver.</p>

          <h3 class="brand-color">VISIBILITY</h3>
          <p class="justify-text">You should also consider just how important visibility is to your final result. Do the results need to be seen from afar or does it just need to be permanent for the sake of identification or trace-ability? Some applications might require paint filling to achieve optimal visibility, while others might call for a completely different approach, like switching to a CO2 friendly product.</p>

          <h3 class="brand-color">ENVIRONMENT</h3>
          <p class="justify-text">The longevity of a mark is directly proportional to the environment it will live in. If the final product will be exposed to the outside elements, chemical wash-downs or extreme temperatures, you will need to consider how this will affect the integrity and visibility of the engraved product. You may even find the need to switch to a more durable material all together.</p>

          <h3>Flying Optics Laser System</h3>
          <p>Flying optics (fig 2) is the most common and recognized option for beam delivery. By mounting small mirrors on a movable X and Y axis, a laser beam can be transferred across a very large plane. However, this reduces processing speed significantly as the X and Y movements are no where near the initial speed of light you start out with.</p>
          <h3>Galvanometer Driven Laser System</h3>
          <p>Conversely, two small mirrors can be mounted onto tiny galvanometers (fig 1) that rotate at extraordinary speeds to help steer the beam across the X and Y plane. Aside from being faster, galvos require far less maintenance as there are less moving parts to worry about. However, this comes at the cost of having a much smaller work area to play with.</p>

          <p class="justify-text">Due to the imminence amount of energy a laser produces, the laser source always requires cooling. High-line CO2 lasers are more efficient and can be air cooled, while entry level models will require a water pump or chiller to maintain ideal temperature. Furthermore, due to the constant burning of materials, an exhaust system is required to either port the toxic fumes out of the work area or into a stand-alone filtration cabinet.</p>

They are used in applications where achieving the smallest spot size is not critical, or at relatively long focal lengths when more complex shapes would not be beneficial.</p>
          <p>Meniscus lenses have a concave curve on one side and a convex curve on the other. At relatively short focal lengths, a meniscus lens will yield a smaller focused spot than a plano-convex lens.

          <p>Focal lenses are usually referred to by their focal distances.

Focus tolerance is particularly important for cutting applications.</p>
          <p>Conversely, as the focal distance is decreased so does the diameter of the spot size. The smaller the spot size, the higher the resolution you can achieve and the greater the intensity of the laser beam becomes. Smaller focal distances are most often used for detailed engraving and fine cutting applications where having a high focus tolerance is not as important.</p>

          <h3>Venting Outdoors</h3>
          <p>Venting your CO2 laser outdoors is certainly the least expensive route to take. However, there is a lot more to it than just sticking a hose out the window. You must decide a number a things like where to install the exhaust fan, how to run the ducting, how to replace the air being sucked out of the room, how to maintain the desired temperature in the room and finally where to point the end of the exhaust duct.</p>
          <p>A good laser exhaust system is one that is quiet, removes smoke and odors, helps in reducing sparks and flaming and creates a safe working environment. The result of having such a system will be an improvement in engraving and cutting quality, with both a decrease in smoke residue on your work pieces and the need for cleaning inside the laser system.</p>

          <h3>Fume Extractors</h3>
          <p>The simplest and most responsible way to ventilate a CO2 laser is with a fume extractor. Fume extractors are basically tightly sealed cabinets containing an exhaust fan and a series of various filtration media divided into stages. The fumes are sucked out from the laser, pushed through each of the filtration stages and then spit back out into the room where they are once again safe for the environment and for everyone in it. There is no need to worry about ducting, replacement air, temperature control or harming the environment.</p>
          <p>However, the cost of replacement filters now becomes a consumable item that will add to your cost of ownership. Therefore, it's important that you choose the proper fume extractor for your CO2 laser. The exhaust fan in the fume extractor will need to remove a certain volume of air (CFM) from the CO2 laser's cabinet. In addition, the combination of filter layers and types of chemicals used, will determine how effective and how efficient your fume extractor will operate. Matching your fume extractor to your laser's cabinet size and to your unique application(s) is fundamental to maximizing the performance of the laser and the life of your filters.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">IRS Tax Code Section 179</h3>
          <p>Many business owners are unaware that Equipment Finance Agreements, $1.00 Buyout Leases and 10% Put Agreements all qualify for the Section 179 tax break. IRS Tax Code Section 179 allows a business to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying financed or leased equipment, including CO2 lasers. The deduction caps at $1,000,000 and the equipment must be placed into service within the same tax year that the deduction is being taken.</p>
          <p>Everyone's situation is different, so it's important you contact your tax adviser to confirm how you may benefit from this tax break. The example above shows the best case scenario for someone who gets taxed at a 35% tax brackets. Your situation may differ.</p>

          <h3>GETTING A GOOD DEAL ON A CO2 LASER IS ONE THING. LEARNING TO USE AND MAINTAIN IT IS ANOTHER.</h3>
          <p class="lead">GETTING A GOOD DEAL ON A CO2 LASER HAS LESS TO DO WITH THE PRICE YOU PAY AND MORE TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE SALE, ESPECIALLY AS TIME GOES ON. THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF TECH SUPPORT, RESOURCES, AND WARRANTY WILL INFLUENCE YOUR ROI FOR YEARS TO COME.</p>

          <h3 class="brand-color">STARTUP TRAINING</h3>
          <p class="justify-text">Even if you've worked with CO2 lasers in the past, it takes many years before you've learned even a fraction of what there is to know. While the internet is a good source for troubleshooting, there are not many places where you can learn all the do's and don'ts or even find basic advice on best practices. Beware of any company that does not offer any sort of training or orientation. In the end, you always get what you pay for.</p>

          <h3 class="brand-color">TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h3>
          <p class="justify-text">No matter how much you spend on a CO2 laser engraver, don't lose sight of the fact that it's still a machine. Some CO2 lasers are obviously better built than others, but even the top of the line laser is only as good as the technical support it comes with. Not if, but when something malfunctions, you need to make sure you have someone you can easily contact for help and that won't try to take advantage of you in a time of need.</p>

          <h3 class="brand-color">WARRANTY</h3>
          <p class="justify-text">As with any expensive electronic, a warranty is pretty standard. Even the lower end CO2 lasers will come with a 1 year warranty. However, that does not mean that the claim process will be easy. Make absolutely certain that you discuss the complete warranty process with your local dealer. Ensure that they have a plan in place for minimizing downtime, that replacement parts are readily available and that they are stocked nearby.</p>

          <p class="lead">WHILE PURCHASING A CO2 LASER IS A BIG INVESTMENT, IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO WHAT IT WILL ULTIMATELY COST TO OWN ONE. THINK, NOT JUST IN TERMS OF MONEY, BUT IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH TIME IT WILL CONSUME.</p>

          <h3>Time vs. Money</h3>
          <p>It's easy to get wrapped up in the initial purchase and not spend much time looking beyond that. Whether you're purchasing a CO2 laser for fun, or planning on using it to generate income, owning a CO2 laser is a long term commitment. Who you purchase your laser from, will determine the terms of that commitment, and how much of your time and money it will take from you over time.</p>
          <p>Things like training, technical support, quality control, fast response times, and expedited repairs will all be reflected in that initial price tag. Furthermore, the rate at which you'll be able to produce, is also a big part of that equation. As with most things in life, what you don't pay for upfront with money, you'll end up financing with your precious time. But one thing is certain, the bill will always come. Waster your money, and you're only out of money, but waste you time, and you've lost part of your life.</p>

          <h3>RF Laser Tube vs. DC Laser Tube</h3>
          <p>There are several consumables that come into play that add to the cost of owning a CO2 laser. For the most part, the components that wear out the fastest (belts, bearings, sensors, mirrors and optics) are relatively inexpensive and easy to replace. However, after years of use, your CO2 laser will inevitably run out of gas.  At which point, you will need to replace or refurbish the laser source or "tube" as it's commonly referred to.</p>
          <p>DC or "glass" laser tubes are the most economical. While they are less efficient and require water as a cooling method, they are superb for cutting applications. Once the gas runs out, the glass tube is simply discarded and replaced with a new one. RF or "metal" laser tubes are extremely efficient and a lot more stable. They can also be pulsed much faster than DC laser tubes, and are therefore found in the upper most tier of laser brands. However, just like with luxury vehicles, when it comes time to replace it, you'd better to be sitting down. A RF tube will typically last 2-3 times longer than a DC tube, but can easily cost  5-10 times as much to replace. Factoring in the replacement cost, is an essential part of making an informed decision.</p>
